# Java Projects: Faculty Data and Simple Calculator

## Overview

This repository contains two basic Java applications:

1. **Faculty Data**: A program that takes faculty-related inputs such as name, grade, degree, number of subjects, and pass status, and displays the data.
2. **Simple Calculator**: A program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers (addition, subtraction, division, and modulo).

These applications are simple projects aimed at demonstrating fundamental concepts in Java, including:
- User input handling using `Scanner`.
- Performing basic arithmetic operations.
- Displaying formatted output.
